Overlook
Abstract:

    This in an interactive web-based application with two different User modes, Admin and Customer. The customer site allows users to view all 
    future and past bookings, create new and remove bookings and view info about their created bookings! The Admin center allows the 
    hotel manager to view all customers that have ever created a booking, create/ remove bookings for any certain customer and view daily 
    stats for the hotel.

Installation Instructions:

    Open terminal and navigate where you would like to store the application.
    Click SSH and copy and paste git@github.com:trevorfitz0/Overlook.git into your terminal.
    cd into the repository on your local machine and run npm install or npm i to install project dependencies.
    Run npm start in the terminal to launch the API's server.
    Open the link to your local server (listed in your terminal) in your web browser to view the live page.
    Control + C is the command to stop running the local server.

Context:

    I completed this project in the 11th week of the Turing front end software engineering program, the project took roughly a week to create and 
    I am excited to share it!

Learning Goals:

    Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
    Implement ES6 classes with a complex data model
    Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information
    Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
    Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
    Make network requests to retrieve data
    Store data in Session storage so Admin can access information regarding user interaction
    Create dry/semantic HTML
    Run third party tests to make sure app is accessible

Technologies Used:

    Fetch API (GET, POST, DELETE)
    Git/GitHub
    Trello project board
    JavaScript
    CSS
    HTML
    Mocha JavaScript testing framework
    Chai assertion library
    Test driven development
    Lighthouse
    Wave

Wins + Challenges:

Wins

    • I was able to quickly setup my Fetch functions and grab all the required data from an external server. 
    • I used Session Storage in combination with Fetch protocols to ensure refresh of the page does not effect the current user state. 
    • I really challenged myself with html and css here, this is the best looking website I have created so far. 

Challenges:

    • This was a lot of work to complete in little time, I was putting in 8 hour work days. 
    • Making the css sizing dynamic with the page movement was a large challenge on this. 
    • Refactoring because of my lack of classes at the beginning of the project.
